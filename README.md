#mytunes

MyTunes is a project that explores Backbone and separating the views and models. It was a fun little experiment that showed why organizing code in this manner is beneficial when compared to doing single-page apps in a single jQuery block.

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. This project was worked
on with a pair; it's representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled,
but not of my solo work.
